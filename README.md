# TSP Solver Tool

## Inputs to reach each point in the program:

- Start Program

- Proceed the application

### 4.1 Backtracking Algorithm [T2.1]

- Calculate TSP with Backtracking Brute Force

### Triangular Approximation Heuristic [T2.2]

- Calculate TSP with Triangular Approximation (Beware that this will make the graph fully connected which may take some time)

### 4.3. Other Heuristics [T2.3]

- Calculate TSP with Nearest Neighbour algorithm (Beware that this will make the graph fully connected which may take some time)

### 4.4. TSP in the Real World [T2.4]

- Calculate TSP for incomplete Graphs
